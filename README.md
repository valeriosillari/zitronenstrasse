# FEATURE: VUE3 + GQL

## TODO:

-   check Plugins for : MAP
-   check Plugins for : COOKIES
-   check Plugins for : TRACKING

-   error page (use layout, no transition effect)

-   set all styles as VAR by bootstrap (request as much as possible)
-   space with REM (trick as pixels)
-   split sass variables in more files?
-   sass font file with all vars

-   splash screen
-   no js

-   sitemap (dynamic data from CMS)

-   transition between pages (improve animations)

-   set typescript logic for types

## NICE TO HAVE / CHECK AGAIN:

-   filter (where) for data of single page (gql query)
-   load data at page switch? cannot pre genearted all data? >> REAL STATIC + git hooks?

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.
